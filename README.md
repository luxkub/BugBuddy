## BugBuddy v1.4.0 Release

BugBuddy is a user-friendly BugTracker system designed to help you manage and track bugs in your projects. In this release (v1.4.0), we've introduced a new feature that allows users to add and view notes directly on the details page of a bug. This enhancement aims to streamline communication and collaboration around specific bug instances.

### What's New in v1.4.0

#### 1. Bug Notes
Users can now add and view notes directly on the edit or details page of a bug.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (version XYZ)
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) (version XYZ)

## How to Use the New Feature

With the latest version (v1.4.0) of BugBuddy, take advantage of the new feature:

1. Open your BugBuddy project in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to the details page of a bug.
3. Add new notes using the "Add Note" section.
4. View existing notes in the "Notes" section, sorted with the newest notes displayed first.

## Additional Enhancements from Previous Releases

In case you missed the improvements from the previous release (v1.3.0), here's a quick recap:

#### 1. Automatic Status Change on Resolution
Entering a resolution when editing a bug now automatically changes the status to "Closed" when saving. This streamlines the bug resolution process and ensures accurate status updates.

#### 2. Newest Bugs Displayed First
Bugs are now sorted with the newest ones displayed first. This improves the usability of the BugBuddy interface by presenting the most recent issues at the top of the list.

#### 3. Checkbox for Displaying Open Bugs Only
A new checkbox has been added to allow users to filter and display open bugs only. This enhances the bug visibility options, providing a quick way to focus on unresolved issues.

#### 4. Priority-Based Bug Coloring
Bug priority is now visually represented with different colors:
- Low priority bugs are displayed in green.
- Medium priority bugs are displayed in orange.
- High priority bugs are displayed in pink.

Thank you for using BugBuddy!
