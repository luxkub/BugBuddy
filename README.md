# BugBuddy v1.3.0 Release

BugBuddy is a user-friendly BugTracker system designed to help you manage and track bugs in your projects. In this release, we introduce several new features and enhancements that improve the bug tracking experience.

## What's New in v1.3.0

### 1. Automatic Status Change on Resolution
Entering a resolution when editing a bug now automatically changes the status to "Closed" when saving. This streamlines the bug resolution process and ensures accurate status updates.

### 2. Newest Bugs Displayed First
Bugs are now sorted with the newest ones displayed first. This improves the usability of the BugBuddy interface by presenting the most recent issues at the top of the list.

### 3. Checkbox for Displaying Open Bugs Only
A new checkbox has been added to allow users to filter and display open bugs only. This enhances the bug visibility options, providing a quick way to focus on unresolved issues.

### 4. Priority-Based Bug Coloring
Bug priority is now visually represented with different colors:
- Low priority bugs are displayed in green.
- Medium priority bugs are displayed in orange.
- High priority bugs are displayed in pink.
